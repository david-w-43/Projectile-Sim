Immediate to-do:
	Use width of canvas in queue population algorithm to minimise the number of points to be plotted
	Implement real-time plotting using a timer
	Implement frame queue inside Form1, reducing the amount of processor time to update the picturebox


Possible:
	Image resizing

	Find y in terms of x (convert to parabola)
		Solve with matrices

	List saved presets and binary search using recursion
